# Delphi-Android-USB-HID
This is a simple clone of the Jedi JVCL library to access Hid devices on Android with Delphi.
Not all functions fom the original JVCL library are available.
But this simple clone will allow you to control most Hid devices.
It is designed to control Microchip MCUs with USB and the HID firmare.
But other applications can be made to function.
